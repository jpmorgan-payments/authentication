### Generating test certificates

You can follow the below commands to get setup with some testing certificates. To use these against JP Morgan APIs you will need to onboard them on developer.jpmorgan.com

```bash
openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out publickey.crt
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out pkcs8.key
```
